# Lore – Technical Details & Implementation Plan

## 1. Core Architecture & MVP
- **Mobile App (iOS/Android):** Use a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native or Flutter) for rapid prototyping, or native if CarPlay/Android Auto integration is a priority.
- **Backend Services:** Cloud-based backend (Node.js, Python, or similar) for story management, user profiles, analytics, and personalization.
- **Content Management System (CMS):** Web-based admin portal for uploading, editing, and curating stories.

## 2. Key Features & Implementation Steps

### A. Audio Story Engine
- **Geolocation Integration:** Use device GPS to determine current location and route.
- **Content Delivery:** Fetch and play stories relevant to the user’s location, route, and preferences.
- **Audio Playback:** Integrate high-quality narration and TTS fallback (e.g., Amazon Polly, Google TTS).
- **Offline Support:** Cache stories for major routes and offline playback.

### B. Personalization
- **User Preferences:** Store and recall user-selected themes, favorites, and preferred story lengths.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggest stories based on past listens and current context.

### C. Voice Interaction
- **Voice Recognition:** Integrate with platform voice APIs (SiriKit, Google Assistant, or custom with Speech-to-Text APIs).
- **Natural Language Processing:** Use cloud NLP (Dialogflow, Azure, or OpenAI) to answer questions and handle commands.
- **Hands-Free Controls:** Implement voice commands for playback, story selection, and quizzes.

### D. Route Awareness
- **Map Integration:** Use Mapbox, Google Maps, or Apple Maps APIs for route and POI awareness.
- **Dynamic Story Queue:** Adjust story recommendations as the route changes or detours occur.

### E. Social & Engagement
- **Quiz Mode:** Group quiz logic, voice input for answers, and real-time feedback.
- **Favorites & Sharing:** Allow users to favorite stories and (in future) share them.

### F. Content Creation/Editing
- **CMS:** Admin portal for story upload, editing, and metadata tagging.
- **AI Content:** Optionally integrate generative AI for dynamic story expansion.

## 3. Platform Integrations
- **CarPlay/Android Auto:** Use respective SDKs for infotainment system integration, focusing on voice-first UX and large, simple visuals.
- **Privacy & Data:** Ensure minimal, session-based location storage; clear opt-in for analytics and voice data.

## 4. Analytics & Metrics
- **Event Tracking:** Log story starts/completions, voice commands, quiz participation, and onboarding.
- **User Metrics:** Track engagement, retention, and NPS.

## 5. Milestones & Sequencing
- **Phase 1:** MVP with geolocation-based story playback.
- **Phase 2:** CarPlay/Android Auto integration and CMS.
- **Phase 3:** Voice Q&A and quiz mode.
- **Phase 4:** Launch, collect feedback, iterate.

## 6. Team & Process
- **Agile Sprints:** 1–2 week sprints, rapid prototyping, and user testing.
- **Small Team:** 1–2 engineers, 1 product manager, 1 content creator.
